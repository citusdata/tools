usage: docker_pulls repo [since]

    repo : a citusdata Docker Hub repository name
    since : a date (optional) in YYYY-MM-DD format

docker_pulls outputs a CSV-formatted pull total for a given repo in citusdata's
org. As Docker Hub can only provide the total number of downloads for all image
versions since the beginning of time, that is what is emitted. Passing the most
recent time point's date as the 'since' parameter will cause this program to
exit without emitting any rows if that parameter is on or after today's date.
